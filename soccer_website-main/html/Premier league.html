        <p class="firstpg"> 
           The English Premier League was formed on February 20, 1992 
           which replaced the English Premier League for the 1992-1993 season.<br>
           The Premier League, also known as the English Premier League or the EPL 
           (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited),
           is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs,
           it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with 
           the English Football League (EFL). <br>
           Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches
           (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).
           Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

        <h1 class="top5"> Top 5 Derby Matches to Watch This Season</h1>
        <div class="derby derbyy">       
            <h2>1. Manchester Derby</h2>
            <p>This is undoubtedly the No. 1 derby you have to watch this season. </p>
            <p> Although this rivalry doesn't have much history—and only became heated last season after City became a title contender—the Manchester derby is an absolute must-watch this season.
              <img class="derbyimg" src="../media/derby manchester.jpg" width="330" height="180" id="manchester"></p>
            <p> With City and United neck-and-neck at the top of the table, the fans are saying that this match will be the title decider. Both sides have dominated their opening fixtures, scoring a whopping 41 goals between them in just six matches.
             In 2010-11, this fixture produced the goal of the season, so make sure you witness the 2011-12 Manchester derby—no matter what. </p>
         </div>

      <div class="derby derbyy">
          <h2>2. North London Derby</h2>
            <p>The North London derby is as exciting as it gets.<p>
            <p>Last season, both North London derbies saw some intense drama on the pitch, heartbreak for some fans and pure happiness for others. 
               <img class="derbyimg" src="../media/north london derby.jpg" width="320" height="180" id="northlondon"></p>
            <p>The first time they faced off in 2010-11, at the Emirates, was an incredible match. With the score 2-0 in Arsenal's favour at the half, 
                it seemed as if the Gunners had it in the bag—but three second half goals from Tottenham meant that Spurs came back away from home ensuring
                 their first ever win at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
            <p>The second time these two sides squared off, at White Hart Lane, an extremely close 3-3 draw was played out in one of the most fast-paced 
                matches of the season. Ultimately, this game was considered to be one of the best from the 2010-11 season.</p>
            <p>Arsenal and Tottenham face off at White Hart Lane this Sunday, so who knows what will happen.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="derby derbyy">
          <h2>3. North West Derby</h2>
            <p>We all know this match simply as Manchester United vs. Liverpool.</p>
            <p>Technically this is a derby between two North Western clubs—a Lancashire derby, but nobody really thinks of it as that. 
              It's a clash between the two most successful clubs in the history of English football, a side with 18 crowns against a side with 19 crowns.

            <p>This is a derby that every one should be keeping an eye on—things always get heated in these matches.</p>

          <h2>4. London Derby</h2>
            <p>Arsenal vs. Chelsea is always a battle of epic proportions.</p>
            <p>Last season, home advantage decided both encounters, with Chelsea winning at Stamford Bridge and Arsenal winning at the Emirates.
               The Blues' win saw a clever early Drogba goal followed by an absolutely stunning freekick from Alex. <img class="derbyimg" 
               src="../media/chelsea vs arsenal.jpg" width="320" height="180" id="london"></p>
            <p>But Arsenal had revenge in their sights the next time around, picking apart their London rivals with a whopping 3-1 victory.</p>
            <p>This is a match about more than just the three points—it's about which club is the pride of London.</p>

          <h2>5. Merseyside Derby</h2>
            <p>Yes, the Merseyside derby has come early this season, so the pressure is on this Sunday.</p>
            <p>This is a classic English rivalry between two sides that just can't stand each other, and when the two clubs from Liverpool face off,
               you know that drama will ensue.  <img class="derbyimg" src="../media/liverpool vs everton.png" width="320" height="150" id="mersi"></p>
            <p>Both clubs have a rich history in the Premier League: Liverpool have the second most titles, while Everton have stayed in the top flight longer than any other club.</p>
            <p>Liverpool tends to get better Premiership finishes these days, but it's virtually impossible to successfully pred the outcome of a Merseyside derby.</p>

            where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million,

              £36.9 million, becoming the most expensive Egyptian player of all time. There, Salah won the Premier League, 
              the UEFA Champions League, the Premier League Golden Boot twice, and finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021.
             <br>  He also holds the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season, and ranks as Liverpool's ninth-highest all-time top goalscorer.
              At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics,
              he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. <br>Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations and
              was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African Footballer of the Year
               (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament,

          <p class="derby player">Mahmoud Ahmed Ibrahim Hassan (Arabic: محمود أحمد إبراهيم حسن)
             born 1 October 1994, commonly known as Trézéguet,is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Süper
              Lig club İstanbul Başakşehir, on loan from Premier League club Aston Villa, and the Egypt national team. His nickname is taken 
              from the French former footballer David Trezeguet, after his former youth coach noticed similarities between the pair in playing 
              style and appearance.<br>
            He began his career with Al Ahly, breaking into the first team at the age of 18 and helping them win the 2012 CAF Champions League and 
            2013 CAF Champions League. In 2015, he joined Belgian team Anderlecht and the move was later made permanent.
             However, he struggled to establish himself in the first team and spent the following two seasons on loan, first with fellow Belgian side
              Mouscron and later Turkish side Kasimpaşa. <br>With Kasimpaşa, he became the highest scoring Egyptian player in the Turkish top flight in a single 
              season which prompted the club to make the transfer permanent in 2018.
             Having represented Egypt at under-20 and under-23 level, Trézéguet made his full debut for the Egyptian senior side in 2014 at 
            the age of 19 in a friendly against Kenya.<br> He was named in Egypt's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, playing in all three group matches.
             To date, he has made over 50 appearances for his country's national team, scoring 8 goals.</p>
