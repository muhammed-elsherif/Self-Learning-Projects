                    Tournment history</h2>
                <p id="history">The Africa Cup of Nations referred to as AFCON,
                    and sometimes as African Cup of Nations,is the main
                    international men's association football competition in Africa.
                    It is sanctioned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF),
                    and was first held in 1957. Since 1968, it has been held every
                    two years, switching to odd-numbered years in 2013.

                    <br>In the first tournament in 1957, there were only three participating
                    nations: Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. South Africa was originally scheduled
                    to join, but was disqualified due to the apartheid policies of the government
                    then in power.Since then, the tournament has expanded greatly, making it necessary
                    to hold a qualifying tournament. The number of participants in the final
                    tournament reached 16 in 1998 (16 teams were to compete in 1996, but Nigeria withdrew,
                    reducing the field to 15, and the same happened with Togo's withdrawal in 2010),
                    and until 2017, the format had been unchanged, with the 16 teams being drawn
                    into four groups of four teams each, with the top two teams of each group advancing
                    to a "knock-out" stage.<br> On 20 July 2017, the Africa Cup of Nations was moved from January to
                    June and expanded from 16 to 24 teams.

                    Egypt is the most successful nation in the cup's history, winning the tournament seven times.Three
                    trophies have been awarded during the
                    tournament's history, with Ghana, and Cameroon winning the first two versions to keep
                    after each of them won a tournament three times. The current trophy was first awarded in 2002.
                    Egypt won an unprecedented three consecutive titles in 2006, 2008, and 2010.

                    In 2013, the tournament format was switched to being held in odd-numbered years so that it
                    wouldn't interfere with the FIFA World Cup.

                    <p >Throughout the history of the Africa Cup of Nations, three trophies
                        have been awarded to the winners of the competition. The original trophy, made of silver, was
                        the Abdelaziz Abdallah Salem Trophy, named after the first CAF president, Egyptian Abdelaziz
                        Abdallah Salem. As the first winner of three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, Ghana obtained
                        the right to permanently hold the trophy in 1978.

                        The second trophy was awarded from 1980 to 2000, and was named "Trophy of African Unity" or
                        "African Unity Cup".It was given to CAF by the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa prior to the
                        1980 tournament and it was a cylindrical piece with the Olympic rings over a map of the
                        continent engraved on it. It sat on a squared base and had stylized triangular handles. Cameroon
                        won the Unity Cup indefinitely after they became three-time champions in 2000.

                        In 2001, the third trophy was revealed, a gold-plated cup designed and made in Italy. Cameroon,
                        permanent holders of the previous trophy, were the first nation to be awarded the new trophy
                        after they won the 2002 edition. Egypt won the gold-plated cup indefinitely after they became
                        three-time champions in 2010. Unlike previous winners who would have then taken the trophy home,
                        Egypt were presented with a special full size replica that they were allowed to keep. The winner
                        of each edition receives a replica whose dimensions are equal to that of the original trophy.

                        CAF give 30 gold medals to the winning team, 30 silver medals to the runners-up, 30 bronze
                        medals to the team ranked third and 30 diplomas to the team ranked fourth in the final
                        tournament.</p>

                However, the CAF announced on
                15 January 2020 that due to unfavourable climatic conditions during that period, the tournament had been
                rescheduled to be played between 9 January and 6 February 2021.On 30 June 2020, the CAF moved the
                tournament's dates for the second time to January 2022 following the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
                across the continent, whilst retaining the name 2021 Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship purposes.</p>

                <p class="finalpg"> on 6 February 2022. Senegal qualified for the knockout stages by finishing at the top of their group
                     with five points. They reached the final by beating Equatorial Guinea and Burkina Faso in the quarter-final 
                     and semi-final respectively. Egypt finished second in Group D behind Nigeria. They defeated Morocco in the quarter-finals,
                      and then knocked out hosts Cameroon on penalties.

                    <br>There were no goals scored in the first 90 minutes of the match, and extra-time was goalless as well. 
                    The best chance of the game was a penalty taken by Sadio Mané, which was saved by Egyptian goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal
                     in the seventh minute. Neither team had much clear-cut chances. With the score level, the match went to a penalty shoot-out.
                      The score was 3-2 to Senegal when Édouard Mendy made a decisive save from Mohanad Lasheen; Mane, who had missed his earlier penalty,
                       decided the match when he scored past Gabal to give Senegal the title.</p>
