      <h2>Senegal national football team</h2>
      <hr/>
      <img id="slogo" src="../media/senghal.png">
      <p>The Senegal national football team ,nicknamed the Lions of Teranga, represents Senegal in international association football and is operated by the Senegalese Football Federation.
        Senegal advanced to the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, becoming the second team from Africa (behind Cameroon in 1990). They managed to upset defending world champions France, draw with Denmark and Uruguay, and beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16, before losing to Turkey in the quarter-finals.

Senegal’s first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, when they, after being group runners-up, lost 1–0 to Ivory Coast for 4th place. They hosted the 1992 African Cup of Nations, where they made it to the quarter-finals. They won their first international trophy at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, defeating Egypt in the final.

  <h2>Africa cup of nations :</h2>
  <p>Historically, Senegal was seen as a weaker side in the strong West African region. Although they finished in fourth place in two AFCON editions,Senegalese performance was overall still deemed as poor. Senegal remained under the shadow of West African giants Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana for the majority of the 20th century.

  <br>  In the 2000s, Senegal began to surge and became a more competitive opponent in the Africa Cup of Nations. Following a successful FIFA World Cup debut in 2002, in which the side reached the quarter-finals, Senegal established itself as a new powerhouse in Africa. The 2002 Africa Cup of Nations tournament marked a defeat to Cameroon 2–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the final.[30] Senegal once again finished as runners-up in 2019, losing the final 0–1 to Algeria,and finally won their first AFCON title in 2021.</p>
