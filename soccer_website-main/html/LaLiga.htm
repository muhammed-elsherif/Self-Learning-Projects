	<p id="introduction">The first football league in Spain was The Catalan football championship (Campionat de Catalunya), established in 1901. After the creation of the La Liga, The Catalan football championship co-existed with the national league for some years until it was cancelled in 1940.<br>
La Liga, <b>the first national football league in Spain was founded in 1929</b> (the first season started in February that year and ended in June). At this time, it consisted of one division, Primera División, and contained ten clubs. The numbers of clubs would later expand at several occasions. In 1987, it reached 20 clubs and that have remained except a short period (1995-1997) with 22 clubs.</p>

    <img id="ramos" src ="../media/ramos.jpg">

    <p id="realmadrid"><b>1)Real Madrid - 34 titles<b><br>
Los Merengues have won LaLiga Santander more than any other club, managing to finish first in 34 of the 90 seasons in which they have featured in the competition. Alongside FC Barcelona and Athletic Club de Bilbao they are the only team in LaLiga to have never been relegated.<br>
The last time Los Blancos won LaLiga Santander was in the 2019/20 season. Zinedine Zidane’s charges finished on 87 points, having won 26 games, drawn nine and lost three. Another notable and close-fought campaign in which Real Madrid came out victorious was the 2011/12 season, in which they reached 100 points, a feat which had previously never been achieved in the competition’s history.</p>

    <img id="messi" src ="../media/messi.jpg">

    <p id="barcelona"><b>2)FC Barcelona - 26 titles<b><br>
Barça are second in the ranking of most LaLiga Santander titles won, having done so 26 times. They have won ten of these titles since the turn of the century and have won more league titles than any other club in the last decade, five in total.<br>
From the 2008/09 season onwards, Les Culés managed to win LaLiga Santander in three consecutive seasons. In 2012/13, they managed to equal the record of 100 points in a season previously just held by Real Madrid. The last time Barcelona won the league was in 2018/19, in which Leo Messi scored 36 times to finish the season as the Pichichi, followed by his teammate Luis Suarez who struck on 21 occasions.</p>

    <img id="saurez" src ="../media/saurez.jpg" >

    <p id="atleticomadrid"><b>3)Atletico Madrid - 11 titles<b><br>
Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid have already gone down in history as a legendary team and are also the reigning champions of LaLiga Santander. Since the Argentine took the reins at the club in 2011, the club have won two league titles, which means that they have 11 in total.
Atletico fans have many unforgettable title-winning memories. There have been the double-winning side of the 1995/96 campaign, and Diego Godin’s piercing header that nearly broke the back of the net at the Camp Nou stadium to win the title in the 2013/14 season, and most recently the epic climax to LaLiga Santander 2020/21. Los Rojiblancos came from behind to beat Real Valladolid on the last day of the season thanks to goals from Angel Correa and Luis Suarez.</p>
